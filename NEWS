Changes in robmed version 0.5.0

    + Changed components 'c' and 'c_prime' to 'direct' and 'total',
      respectively, to avoid confusion with different notation in different
      papers.

    + Removed deprecated functions.



Changes in robmed version 0.4.0

    + Output of summaries restructured to be similar to PROCESS macro of Andrew
      Hayes.

    + Wrapper function indirect() is now deprecated.

    + Added missing reference in help file of example data.



Changes in robmed version 0.3.0

    + Added method based on median regressions (Yuan & MacKinnon, 2014).



Changes in robmed version 0.2.0

    + Added shiny app for comparing bootstrap methods on simulated data with
      outliers.

    + Added support for multiple mediators for standard and robust bootstrap
      tests based on regressions.

    + Redesigned functions to live in the tidyverse: using under_scores instead
      of camelCase; first argument of fit_mediation() and test_mediation() is a
      data frame.

    + Added method based on robust regressions and fast and robust bootstrap,
      which is the new default method.

    + Wrapper function indirect() now always uses the bootstrap test



Changes in robmed version 0.1.1

    + Bugfix in density plot: bootstrap replicates for indirect effect are now
      correctly extracted.
